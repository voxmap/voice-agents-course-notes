    One thing we see _a lot_ in the general WebRTC world is if latency gets much above 1 second, you get lots of cases of people talking over (and interrupting) the bot because they're not sure the bot heard them, etc

    A few things.
    - Pipecat is fully vendor neutral. It's not tightly coupled to any infrastructure. (If you build with LiveKit, you deploy to LiveKit.)
    - Pipecat is a fully programmable pipeline.
    Kwin can add more context, too!

    Are there any plans to let us run logic on groq cloud? Last I tried the network latency put time to first token to be a bit slower than I expected, but once I started getting tokens it was crazy fast. Would be unbelievable if I could run it all on groq so there's single digit ms latency

    of course! 😁  what do you mean exactly by run logic? i'm not sure how long ago you tried, but to combat this, we're building up data centers globally to reduce network latency as well. we will keep optimizing what we can to make the entire pipeline faster.

    Pipecat is an open-source framework for building AI pipelines, primarily focused on voice.
    Daily is the company behind Pipecat. Our primary business is providing realtime voice and video communication. Our APIS are built on top of WebRTC.
    These overlap in that, to connect a client to a Pipecat pipeline, the voice/video must communicate over some connection, websockets or WebRTC. Pipecat allows you to chose that connection, but our preferred way is using a Daily connection, or in PIpecat terms, a DailyTransport.

    I think there's a pipecat example of this somewhere, esp for a v2v model where the context gets full of audio data pretty quick. you can replace the audio context with the text transcript, or even run the transcript through a separate LLM with a prompt to summarize it

    Not aware of any out-of-the-box solution. Way I've automated this process before is to transcribe the call recording and measure the difference between the timestamp for the end of the last utterance of one speaker and the first utterance of the next speaker.

    It sounded very artificial and it made it harder to follow and the agent didn't work as well. Much better to use appropriate pauses and speech timing. We use a mix of LLM prompt optimization, prompt engineering, and in some cases a little creative editing to get more natural sounding reactions.
